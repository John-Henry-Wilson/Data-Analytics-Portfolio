John Wilson | Data Analyst
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! My name is John Wilson, and I am a highly motivated and disciplined individual with a strong passion for data analysis and problem-solving. My journey into data analytics is fueled by a diverse range of experiences and a deep love for continuous learning.

I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in December 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, alongside minors in Mathematics and Japanese Language. My academic journey was marked by a strong performance, achieving a GPA of 3.699, and a focus on key areas such as Algorithm Analysis & Design, Database Systems, Machine Learning, and Cryptographic Algorithm Design & Analysis.

Throughout my career, I have applied my analytical skills in various settings. As a Temporary State Employee at the Colorado Department of Health and Environment, I handled critical data entry tasks with precision and ensured efficient document organization. My technical skills were further honed during my time as an IT Assistant at Vintage IT, where I provided technical support and managed hardware and software installations for Texas Workforce employees.

In addition to my professional experience, I bring a unique blend of creativity and discipline developed through over 14 years of martial arts training and 3+ years of performing stand-up comedy. These experiences have not only enhanced my resilience and leadership skills but also sharpened my ability to think on my feet, communicate effectively, and approach challenges with a problem-solving mindset.

My technical skill set includes proficiency in Python (my primary language), C++, and SQL, as well as a solid foundation in object-oriented programming techniques, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. I am also experinced in using other technologies and tools such as R, Excel, and Tableau, and I hold a Professional Scrum Master I certification as well as a Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

In this portfolio, you will find projects that reflect my analytical capabilities, creativity, and commitment to excellence. I am passionate about using data to drive informed decisions, and I am always eager to learn new techniques and tools that can help me make a positive impact.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting and exploring opportunities to contribute to exciting projects in the data analytics space.
